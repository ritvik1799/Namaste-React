EPSIODE 1 :

 In this we learn basics of react.
 we use react using react cdn link.
 CDN - content Delivery Network
 Cross-origin 
 async-defer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPISODE 2 :

## In this we will create our own create react app.
 
-> npm init -> to initialize npm , we confifure npm here

## Now we install Bundler package "Parcel" , other Bundler available are webpack,viet etc.

 # Parcel
 - creating dev build
 - host it on localhost server
 - HMR : Hot Module Replacement (automatic refreshment on saving new changes)
 - File watching Algorithm : written in c++
 - Faster Build by Using Caching and create build of modified changes only. And it do all caching in .parcel-cache folder.
 - Image Optimization
 - Minification of files
 - Bundling of Files
 - compress the files
 - Differencial bundling - to support older browsers also
 - Support of host to HTTPS also
 - tree shaking : remove unused code from code 
 - Different dev and production bundle


-> npm install -D parcel  (telling package manager (npm) to install parcel as dev dependency (-D))

## when we install parcel we get a file package-lock.json and nod_modules too in project.

## if we don't have nod_modules but have package.json and package-lock.json file we can generate nod_modules using npm install that's
## why we need not to push nod_modules to github 

-> npm install 

## when we type npx parcel index.htm we execute parcel so it bundle our code using source file index.html and create build and host it
## on server localhost:1234.

-> npx parcel index.html

## we are installing react now using/from npm and we install it as normal dependency not dev dependency (-D)

-> npm install react
-> npm i react-dom

## we will create production Build now using :  (npx parcel index.html create development)

-> npx parcel build index.html

## "browserslist":[ "last 2 versions" ] this in package.json make or project compitable to work on last 2 vesrion of any browsers
## we can write also like "last 2 chrome versions" it implie that our project work fine in last 2 version of chrome surely
## don't sure about other browser version it may run or may not.
