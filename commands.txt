EPSIODE 1 :

 In this we learn basics of react.
 we use react using react cdn link.
 CDN - content Delivery Network
 Cross-origin 
 async-defer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPISODE 2 :

## In this we will create our own create react app.
 
-> npm init -> to initialize npm , we confifure npm here

## Now we install Bundler package "Parcel" , other Bundler available are webpack,viet etc.

 # Parcel
 - creating dev build
 - host it on localhost server
 - HMR : Hot Module Replacement (automatic refreshment on saving new changes)
 - File watching Algorithm : written in c++
 - Faster Build by Using Caching and create build of modified changes only. And it do all caching in .parcel-cache folder.
 - Image Optimization
 - Minification of files
 - Bundling of Files
 - compress the files
 - Differencial bundling - to support older browsers also
 - Support of host to HTTPS also
 - tree shaking : remove unused code from code 
 - Different dev and production bundle


-> npm install -D parcel  (telling package manager (npm) to install parcel as dev dependency (-D))

## when we install parcel we get a file package-lock.json and nod_modules too in project.

## if we don't have nod_modules but have package.json and package-lock.json file we can generate nod_modules using npm install that's
## why we need not to push nod_modules to github 

-> npm install 

## when we type npx parcel index.htm we execute parcel so it bundle our code using source file index.html and create build and host it
## on server localhost:1234.

-> npx parcel index.html

## we are installing react now using/from npm and we install it as normal dependency not dev dependency (-D)

-> npm install react
-> npm i react-dom

## we will create production Build now using :  (npx parcel index.html create development)

-> npx parcel build index.html

## "browserslist":[ "last 2 versions" ] this in package.json make or project compitable to work on last 2 vesrion of any browsers
## we can write also like "last 2 chrome versions" it implie that our project work fine in last 2 version of chrome surely
## don't sure about other browser version it may run or may not.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPISODE 3 : Laying The Foundation

## Till now we are using npx index.html or npx parcel build index.html to start project but from now onword we are going to use script
## tag to start project . we define script to start or build in package.json file under script attribute . suppose we define start tag
## with value parcel.index.html to start project so from now we have to write npm run start or a shortcut npm start (but thsi work only
##  for start not for other) to run our project instead of npx parcel index.html . This is industry standard.

## React.createElement create Object for us , at the end of the day react element is object when we render it using react dom it 
## become html. But it become very annoying and Clumsy so to avoid it we Use JSX.

## Suppose we have to create Create React element h1 using JSX so we have to write just :
## const heading = <h1>This is headin in JSX</h1>

## JSX : It's a javaScript syntax to create react element. it make developer life easy to create and use react element in convinent way.
## Jsx is not Html in js its syntax like html. ( React , JSX, HTML all are Different things)

## More about JSX :
## JSX is not a valid pure javaScript at the same time . Basically we say pure javaScript to that which can understood by js engine
## and js engine can understand es6/ECMAscript ,sp browser unable to understand JSX it give syntax error as "<" for this.
## so basically Our code is Transpiled into the code js engine can understand or browser can understand . and this conversion generally 
## done by bundlers so this transpiling is done by Parcel and Parcel didn.t do this it give this duty to pacakge known as "Babel".
## Babel is a javaScript compiler. so basicall it is responsible for taking our JSX code and Converting / transpiling it into code
## that browser / JS engine / react can understand.
## Working of JSX JSX code => React.createElement() => ReactElement-JS object => HtmlElemet(render)

## React Components : It's a common say that everything in react is a component
## Two way to create react component First one is Class based Components (OLD ONE) , Second one is Functional Components (NEW ONE)
## class base use javaScript classes to create react component and Functional component use javaScript Function to create Components.

## React Functional Components : it is just a javaScript Function. name should start from Capital letter. we can say react Functional
## component is a javaScript Function which return react element.
## we have to render react Components like root.render(<componentName/>). This is how babel understand that it is component.

## component Composition : composing two or more than two components into each other or adding component inside component 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPISODE 4 : From This onward we are making a real world app

## Before making any app we should plan it properly it make development process easy.

## <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by 
## allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
## <></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment`. The only difference between them is that the shorthand version does not 
## support the key attribute.

#### Example

## return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </React.Fragment>
    );

## return (
        <>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </>
    );

## `Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use 
## a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between 
## the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components.
## React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new 
## Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
## React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM 
## leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.
## 
##                                  (or)
## 
## Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI to reflect changes in the component state. The reconciliation algorithm 
## is the set of rules that React uses to determine how to update the UI in the most efficient way possible. React uses a virtual 
## DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI.

## React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.
## The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React’s 
## reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.
## Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:
## 
## - Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
## - Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
## - Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance

## A `key` is a special attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify 
## which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are unique Identifier used to give 
## an identity to the elements in the lists.
## Keys should be given to the elements within the array to give the elements a stable identity.

## we can use index as key but its not recommended by react itself.

## Props : props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data 
## from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). They are useful when you want the flow of data in 
## your app to be dynamic.

## DOM stands for `Document Object Model`, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, 
## this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, 
## style, and structure of the document.

## - `Virtual DOM`

##   - The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated 
##     without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesn’t have the ability to 
##     write to the screen like the real DOM.
##   - Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly 
##     apply to the machine.
##   - Reconciliation is a process to compare and keep in sync the two files (Real and Virtual DOM). Diffing algorithm is a technique 
##     of reconciliation which is used by React.

## - `Real DOM`

##   - The DOM represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each branch of the tree ends in a node and 
##   each node contains object programmers can modify the content of the document using a scripting language like javascript and the 
##   changes and updates to the dom are fast because of its tree-like structure but after changes, the updated element and its children 
##   have to be re-rendered to update the application UI so the re-rendering of the UI which make the dom slow all the UI components you 
##   need to be rendered for every dom update so real dom would render the entire list and not only those item that receives the update .
